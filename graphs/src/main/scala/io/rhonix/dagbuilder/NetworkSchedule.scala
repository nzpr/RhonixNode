/**
 * Schedule for DAG creation. Each item in LazyList contains a set of messages to create.
 *
 * As messages without causal relation can be processed concurrently, each item in LazyList is a Set.
 * One edge case is a block chain, where Set is of a single item and all senders produce blocks one by one.
 * Another edge case is a full throttle DAG, when all senders always create blocks concurrently.
 * The latter should be used to estimate the maximum throughput of the system.
